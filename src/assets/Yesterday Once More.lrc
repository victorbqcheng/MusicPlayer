[00:00.88]Yesterday Once More
[00:01.24]Carpenters
[00:01.63]
[00:03.18]when i was young i'd listen to the radio
[00:09.22]waiting for my favorite songs
[00:14.86]when they played i'd sing along,
[00:19.56]it make me smile.
[00:24.21]those were such happy times and not so long ago
[00:32.60]how i wondered where they'd gone.
[00:37.75]but they're back again just like a long lost friend
[00:44.28]all the songs i love so well.
[00:49.54]every shalala every wo'wo
[00:56.13]still shines.
[01:01.98]every shing-a-ling-a-ling 
[01:04.55]that they're starting
[01:06.76]to sing so fine
[01:09.45]
[01:13.42]when they get to the part
[01:15.97]where he's breaking her heart
[01:18.77]it can really make me cry
[01:23.71]just like before.
[01:29.33]it's yesterday once more.
[01:38.04](shoobie do lang lang)
[01:42.48]looking bak on how it was in years gone by
[01:48.13]and the good times that had
[01:53.78]makes today seem rather sad,
[01:58.65]so much has changed.
[02:02.10]
[02:06.08]it was songs of love that i would sing to them
[02:11.53]and i'd memorise each word.
[02:16.47]those old melodies still sound so good to me
[02:23.05]as they melt the years away
[02:28.80]every shalala every wo'wo still shines
[02:36.30]
[02:40.30]every shing-a-ling-a-ling 
[02:42.63]that they're startingto sing
[02:45.95]so fine
[02:51.88]all my best memorise come back clearly to me
[02:57.17]some can even make me cry
[03:02.18]just like before.
[03:08.00]it's yesterday once more.
[03:10.96](shoobie do lang lang)
[03:14.39]every shalala every wo'wo still shines.
[03:21.93]
[03:26.54]every shing-a-ling-a-ling 
[03:29.34]that they're starting to sing
[03:31.97]so fine
[03:37.20]every shalala every wo'wo still shines.
